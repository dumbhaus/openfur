      <p>
        Welcome to the OpenFur 2018 transparency report. This report was created in order to help
        educate a discerning public about who furries are, what their culture consists of,
        and how sexuality is treated within the community. This report provides data about posts
        taken from Fur Affinity, the largest furry community on the internet, in order to better
        understand the vast differences in the community. This version of the report utilizes data
        from the year of 2018 and consists of 401,784 data points which is approximately 10% of the
        4,017,836 posts from that year.

          <p>
            In order to gather enough data for this report while also not occupying too much
            time during the data gathering phase, it was decided that a select number of posts
            would be utilized for this report. This report utilizes a 10% sample rate on the
            estimated 4,017,836 total posts on Fur Affinity. This sample rate was choosen in
            order to get the most accurate picture of the Fur Affinity community. These posts
            were randomly selected from a set of all the posts from January 1st, 2018 to December
            31st, 2018. In order to reduce the amount of bias in post selection, a
            cryptographically-secure pseudo random number generator was utilized to select posts
            for study. The full code utilized in this report is avalible on Github as open source
            software and the analysis of the data gathered is also avalible as a JSON file download.
            It is our intent to ensure that this report is as fair to the furry community as possible.

          <h3 class="is-size-4">Content Ratings</h3>
          <p>
            The furry community creates a lot of content. Most of this content is harmless fun,
            however some of this content may be inappropriate for some audiences. This content
            may vary from suggestive material to graphic nudity. FurAffinty offers three different
            ratings for content: general, mature, and adult. General is typically content which is
            meant for the consumption of all ages. Mature contains content that may be inappropriate
            for a minor to view. Adult contains content which is sexually explicit and is only meant
            for adult consumption. More information about these ratings can be found on FurAffnity's
            <a href="https://www.Fur Affinity.net/aup">Acceptable Upload Policy</a> page.

          <h3 class="is-size-4">Identifying Sexualized Content</h3>
          <p>
            Content ratings, however, do not tell the full story of the variety of content avalible
            on Fur Affinity. Often suggestive content or content which might have a sexual background
            can be found mascarading itself as General content. Contrastly, content which is classified
            as Mature does not necessarily mean a sexual nature. For the purposes of this report, a
            different set of classifications has been created in order to identify this content in the
            General and Mature content ratings. These identifiers have been gathered from the top
            tags and themes of the General and Mature content ratings and were selected for their known
            sexualized backgrounds. While not all these identifiers were solely utilized for sexual
            content, more of the content under these tags were of sexual nature than that of other 
            popular identifiers.

            This data shows that while sexual content is not negligable in the furry community,
            it is also not a majority of the content offered. Sexual content appears
            to make up about 43% of the total content avalible on Fur Affinity.

          <h3 class="is-size-4">Types of Sexualized Content</h3>
          <p>
            Sexual content in the furry community ranges from soft-core content which is primarily
            suggestive and contains little to no nudity to hard-core content which contains graphic
            sexual acts. In this report, we attempted to classify certain types of this content and
            measure it's prevalence in the community. These content types were choosen for their 
            known sexual connections in the community. Is it important to note that each of these
            content types are their own independent group of the furry community with their own subgroups.
            Some groups may sexualize the content type more than others. This report makes no judgement on
            how sexual these content types are, and presents these content types as a whole cohesive group
            for easier analysis.

            This report was created to find tangable data about sexuality throughout
            the furry community. This report goes to show that sexuality is not a
            majority of the content avalible on Fur Affinity, the largest furry
            community on the internet. Even so, sexuality is not a negligable
            potion of the content avalible on Fur Affinity. When attention is given
            to the sexual content avalible, much of the content is diversified among a
            large range of different sexual interests making broad generalizations of the
            sexuality of the furry community hard to make. This goes to show that the
            furry community is quite diverse in their feelings towards sexual content and
            their particular taste and expression in sexual content.
